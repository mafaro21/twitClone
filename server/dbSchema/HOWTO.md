## What are these Files?
ANY SINGLE one of the files define 2 things:  **Data Schema** as well as **Validation Rules** for each ``Collection`` in your MongoDb Database. They ensure data integrity at **DATABASE LEVEL** during inserting and updating, *independent of the application* used (unlike Mongoose, which is only applicable in NodeJS apps ðŸ‘Ž). They are called JSON Schema. Learn more about them here: [https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/schema-validation/]

## How to use them.
Please note, these files ARE NOT MEANT TO BE INCLUDED OR USED DIRECTLY IN YOUR APP SOURCE CODE (LIKE MONGOOSE). THEY ARE SPECIFICALLY MEANT for MONGODb Compass. Or, simply they can be used as _reference_ during your app development.

- First, download the free [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) (available for Mac, Linux and Windows).
- Install it and then connect to your existing **database** (or create New one). Then follow these steps:

1. Create a **collection**. Lets start with `users`, for example.
2. Open `twitclone.users.json` file contained here, **SelectAll** and **Copy** (the *content*, NOT THE FILE itself!!!).
3. Now go back to MongoDB Compass > `yourDatabaseName` > `users` Collection > click **Validation** tab.
4. Make sure **Validation Action** == _ERROR_, and **Validation Level** == _STRICT_. Paste the content there and click **Save** at the bottom. DONE.

- Repeat steps 2-4 above for each new `collection` you create, with its corresponding `.json` file.
- You can always **Update** the rules using MongoDB Compass (or CLI) whenever you wish.
