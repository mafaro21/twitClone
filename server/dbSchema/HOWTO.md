## What are these Files?
ANY SINGLE one of the files define 2 things:  **Data Model** as well as **Validation Rules** for each ``Collection`` in your MongoDb Database. They ensure data integrity and Security at **DATABASE LEVEL** during inserting and updating, *independent of the application* used. They are called JSON Schema. Learn more about them here: [https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/schema-validation/]

## How to use them.
Please note, these files ARE NOT MEANT TO BE INCLUDED OR USED IN YOUR APP SOURCE CODE. THEY ARE SPECIFICALLY MEANT to be uploaded to MONGODb ONLY (in the *Validation* section). Or to be used as _reference_ during your app development. And best of all, it is totally OPTIONAL to use them at all! ðŸ˜€. They just make life easier and your data consistent.

- First, download the free [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) (available for Mac, Linux and Windows).
- Install it and then connect to your existing **database** (or create New one). Then follow these steps:

1. Create a **collection**. Lets start with `users`, for example.
2. Open `twitclone.users.json` file contained here, **SelectAll** and **Copy** (the *content*, NOT THE FILE itself!!!).
3. Now go back to MongoDB Compass > `yourDatabaseName` > `users` Collection > click **Validation** tab.
4. Make sure **Validation Action** == _ERROR_, and **Validation Level** == _STRICT_. Paste the content there and click **Save** at the bottom. DONE.

- Repeat steps 2-4 above for each new `collection` you create, with its corresponding `.json` file.
- You can always **Update** the rules using MongoDB Compass (or CLI) whenever or however you wish.
